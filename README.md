# People-Detection-and-Counting-In-Out-Line
A people detection using Yolo v3 and Deep Sort to count people who passes a certain line that delimits the entrance of a place. This program can count the poeple who get into the place or get out.

# Project based On
This project is based on the Deep-Sort Algorithm usimg Yolo v3: https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3
What we are looking forward to resolve in this github is the counting from a line.

# Requirements

# Download pre-trained weights

Before testing the code you must download the weights for the deep learning model for the trackers and the yoloV3.

Drive Link for Deep Sort Weights : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rjZpYVorVCDyx25BkkQ0rdr2wdnYM71X
Drive Link for Yolov3 weights: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvXFacPnrSMw6ldWTyLLjGLETlEsUvcE/view

 <li>You must put the both files into the model_data folder</li>
