# People-Detection-and-Counting-In-Out-Line
A people detection using Yolo v3 and Deep Sort to count people who passes a certain line that delimits the entrance of a place. This program can count the poeple who get into the place or get out.

# Project based On
This project is based on the Deep-Sort Algorithm usimg Yolo v3: https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3
What we are looking forward to resolve in this github is the counting from a line.

# Requirements
For CPU:

  <li>tensorflow>=1.4.0 (not compatible with tf 2.0) #This will be resolved soon</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>sklean</li>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>Pillow</li>


For GPU:

  <li>tensorflow>=1.4.0 (not compatible with tf 2.0) #This will be resolved soon</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>sklean</li>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>Pillow</li>
# Download pre-trained weights

Before testing the code you must download the weights for the deep learning model for the trackers and the yoloV3.
