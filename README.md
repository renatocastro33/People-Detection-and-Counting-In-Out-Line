A people detection using Yolo v3 and Deep Sort to count people who passes a certain line that delimits the entrance of a place. This program can count the poeple who get into the place or get out.

This project is based on the Deep-Sort Algorithm usimg Yolo v3: https://github.com/Qidian213/deep_sort_yolov3
What we are looking forward to resolve in this github is the counting from a line.
